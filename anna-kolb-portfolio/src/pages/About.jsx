      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      Hello and welcome to my art page! My name is Anna Kolb, and I am a high school student with a passion for both tennis, traveling, and painting. Traveling and taking adventures is something I have always been very passionate about. I basically live for traveling! While I spend much of my time on the tennis court, playing for my high school team, I also find great fulfillment in expressing myself through art.

      I love capturing the beauty of the outdoors, from serene landscapes to vibrant florals. Being a part of the team has taught me about teamwork, discipline, and the importance of balancing passion with dedication—lessons that I carry into my artwork as well. One of my greatest joys in painting comes from creating dog portraits. There is something deeply rewarding about bringing out the character and emotion in each pet’s expression. I love seeing the joy and excitement in my customers' faces when they see their beloved pets immortalized on canvas.
