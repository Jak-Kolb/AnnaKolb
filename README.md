# Anna Kolb Art Portfolio Website

This repository contains a small React-based website to showcase an art portfolio. You can run it locally or deploy it later.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Start a simple server (for example `python3 -m http.server 8000`).
3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Customizing the Artwork

Images are defined in `app.jsx` inside the `artworks` array. Replace the placeholder URLs with your own image paths. You can keep your pictures in a local `images/` folder (ignored by git). Reload the page to see your changes.

## Domain Placeholder

When you are ready to deploy, replace `replacethis.com` in the `<link rel="canonical">` tag inside `index.html` with your actual domain (for example `something.com`).
