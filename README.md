# Anna Kolb Art Portfolio Website

This repository contains a simple static website to showcase an art portfolio. You can run it on your local machine or deploy it later.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser. That's it!

## Customizing the Artwork

Add your own image files in a local `images/` folder (ignored by git). Update the `<img>` tags in `index.html` to point to those files. By default the page uses remote placeholders so it works without any images.

## Domain Placeholder

When you are ready to deploy, replace `replacethis.com` in the `<link rel="canonical">` tag inside `index.html` with your actual domain (for example `something.com`).
